## Recently Played Spotify

## Overview

- A React app that uses Spotify's Web API to show you insights on your music preferences via your recently played songs.

- You can see and filter the list of songs by artists you have listened most recently.

- It has been built using React.js & Bootstrap.

## The Task

- Build a Single Page Application using Spotify Web API to meet the below requirements, using the Implicit Grant Flow described within the documentation for authentication.

```
 - A user should be able to view a grid of their recently played tracks.

 - This should include a relevant image for each track.
 - In a sidebar, a user should be able to view a list of all recently played artists.

 - This should be in order of most recently played.

 - On click of an artist, the grid of recently played tracks should be filtered by the relevant artist.

 - BONUS | On refresh of the page, any applied filter should be persisted.
 ```
